A practice project as part of my Javascript learning phase.
it's a basic rock paper scissors game where the computer or the console interface plays against the user.
The game has the following rules.
=> Rock beats Scissors (Rock crushes Scissors).
=> Scissors beats Paper (Scissors cut Paper).
=> Paper beats Rock (Paper covers Rock).
=> Max 05 rounds.

Good Luck playing.
